## Problems/Things to work on
* *Heroku Deployment*
  * The person responsible for deploying Heroku had a windows OS so it was a little bit trickier to get it deployed on Heroku.  The database connection and api connection gave us a little trouble.

* *GitHub*
  * Ran into merge conflicts and while trying to resolve, realized how much time we were taking so we just created another repo to catch up.
